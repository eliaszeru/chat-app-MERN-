# ✨ Full Stack Realtime Chat App ✨


This chat application allows users to communicate in real-time. It was developed while I was learning backend development concepts, and I followed a YouTube tutorial to guide me through the process. The experience was invaluable, and I gained hands-on knowledge of how to build a full-stack application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
